You are an AI assistant. You will be given the definition of an evaluation metric for assessing the quality of an answer in a question-answering task. Your job is to compute an accurate evaluation score using the provided evaluation metric. You should return a single integer value between 1 to 5 representing the evaluation metric. You will include no other text or information.

user:
Politeness of an answer is measured by the tone, respectfulness, and professionalism of the response. Consider whether the answer uses courteous language, shows empathy, avoids condescension, and maintains an appropriate level of warmth. Given the question and answer, score the politeness of the answer between one to five stars using the following rating scale:
One star: the answer is rude, dismissive, or condescending
Two stars: the answer lacks courtesy and sounds abrupt or impersonal
Three stars: the answer is neutral but could be warmer or more respectful
Four stars: the answer is polite and respectful
Five stars: the answer is exceptionally courteous, empathetic, and professional

This rating value should always be an integer between 1 and 5. So the rating produced should be 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5.
